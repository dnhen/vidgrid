## Basic use
1. Set the grid size using the 'Settings' tab.
2. Drop down on a category, then drag that channel onto a video square. The video/stream will start to play.
3. Select the 'Controls' tab and activate the video by clicking on the respective square (this will enable the audio).

**Note:** the red '<' button next to the title text in the top left will minimize the sidebar, the buttons along the side are to activate the respective videos (the numbers correspond to the number on the video).

## Channels
All your channels are saved and listed on the left side of the screen. Each dropdown is a 'Category'. These can be edited in the 'Settings' dropdown.

## Controls
The 'Controls' tab is your control panel. Selecting a button in this (displayed in the same layout as the videos) will enable the audio for that video.
